Java project for "Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance", 
course #2 in "Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures" 
from University of California, San Diego (on Coursera).
==================================================================
Some starter code and the user interface was provided. I developed only 
"back-end" code.
In each file, a //TODO indicates the methods I implemented.

The project for this course was to build a smart text editor/processor 
that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces 
including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. 
In each module I added a bit more functionality to my editor:
- Flesch Readability Score
- Efficiency improvements
- Markov Text Generation
- Spell Checking and Autocomplete
- Spelling Suggestions
- Word Paths
